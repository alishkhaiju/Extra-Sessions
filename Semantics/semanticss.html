          <h1>About Samriddhi College</h1>
          <p>
            Samriddhi College was established with a mission to equip students
            with competencies they need to thrive and grow in an ever
            competitive economic landscape. Our approach to educational
            excellence is primarily rooted in the belief that students need to
            have both character and credentials to lead successful lives and
            play roles of good citizens contributing to greater good of the
            society. This explains the holistic approach we embrace in carrying
            out our academic activities and engaging with our key constituents –
            students, parents and community at large. Our academic portfolio
            spans a range of domains including Information and Communications
            technologies (ICT), business studies and social-works. We at
            Samriddhi believe that there are cross-learning opportunities among
            students and faculty across the range of academic streams that it
            offers leading to holistic learning outcomes. Along those lines, we
            have strategies in place to ensure that such opportunities are
            indeed materialized going forward. Our course offerings are strongly
            anchored to demand side imperatives and embrace market-oriented
            approach. For example, we take extra measures to ensure that our ICT
            courses are aligned with the dynamism shaping the sector
            characterized by rapid technological progress and their
            ramifications in the market. Similarly, our business studies and
            social-work academic streams are geared towards providing students
            with foundational insights aligned with contemporary knowledge and
            practical grounding required to succeed in those areas. Let me take
            this opportunity to invite you to Samriddhi in your quest for
            finding the right program to suit your academic pursuits and career
            goals. Thank you.
